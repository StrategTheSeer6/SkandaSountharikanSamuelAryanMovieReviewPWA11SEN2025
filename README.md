Movie Review Website PWA

Make sure to have installed:
* SQLite3
* flask
* bcrypt
* better_profanity
* Visual Studio Code

To run:
* Download the Git file to downloads
* Open the file in VSC
* Start running app.py
* Ctrl+Click (or CMD+Click for Mac) on the link that is stated on the terminal, where it says the application is running.

There should be no issues, as the above requisites are needed to run the website locally using flask. 

If there are unfortunately any further problems experienced, you can ask Sountharikan to host the website from his laptop using NGROK, and he will send a link for you to open the PWA with.
